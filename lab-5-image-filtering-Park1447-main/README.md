## Special Instructions

### Inserting Images

To insert an image (e.g., `image.png`) in your report
  
  1. Insert a new cell of type `Markdown`.
  2. Enter the following command `<img src="image.png">`.
  3. To scale the inserted image to 60% for example, enter `<img src="image.png" style="width:60%;height:60%;">`.
  4. Be sure that the HTML file you export is in the assignment folder! Otherwise, the images
     will not render properly.
